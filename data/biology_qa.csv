What is the function of the heart?,The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. It provides the body with oxygen and nutrients while removing metabolic wastes.
What is photosynthesis?,"Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, through a process that converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen."
Define osmosis.,Osmosis is the spontaneous movement of solvent molecules (like water) through a selectively permeable membrane from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration.
What are the main parts of a plant cell?,"The main parts of a plant cell include the cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, chloroplasts, and a large vacuole."
Why is chlorophyll important?,Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in chloroplasts. It is essential for photosynthesis because it absorbs light energy from the sun.
What is the difference between an artery and a vein?,"Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, while veins carry deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart. Arteries have thick, elastic walls; veins have thinner walls and have valves."
What is a neuron?,"A neuron, also known as a nerve cell, is the fundamental unit of the brain and nervous system. It is responsible for receiving sensory input and transmitting electrical signals."
Explain the process of respiration.,Respiration is the process by which organisms break down glucose to release energy for cellular activities. It uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.
What is the function of the ribosome?,Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They read messenger RNA (mRNA) and link amino acids together in the order specified by the mRNA to form a protein.
What is a habitat?,"A habitat is the natural home or environment of an animal, plant, or other organism. It provides the organism with the food, water, shelter, and space it needs to survive."
